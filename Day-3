Today I have learnt about VMware that means creating and managing virtual machines.
we can create VM's in 2 ways 
they can be manual and automatic

in manual we can create vm's using any workstations and installing os file and can run those os
in automation we can create vm's as many as we want with the help of vagrant.

vagarant only has 4 commands to start reload,reboot etc
